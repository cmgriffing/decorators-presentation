# Diving Into Decorators

## Poor Title

Too many talks about "diving" into decorators.

- Todd Motto - [https://toddmotto.com/angular-decorators](https://toddmotto.com/angular-decorators)

- This person - [https://cabbageapps.com/fell-love-js-decorators/](https://cabbageapps.com/fell-love-js-decorators/)

- [A Python One](https://www.codementor.io/moyosore/a-dive-into-python-closures-and-decorators-part-1-9mpr98pgr)

- [Another Python One](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/deep-dive-into-python-decorators--cms-25629)

<div class="notes">
After making the slides and submitting the talk I realized that my title was nowhere near original.

So, screw it! I'm just going to dive into the diving metaphor. I hope it doesnt hurt too much.
